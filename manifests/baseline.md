# CV Manifest — Baseline

## Purpose

This is the **general-purpose baseline** manifest for Luis Vela Vela's CV. It represents the full breadth of experience and skills without tailoring for any specific role. Role-specific manifests in `roles/` describe what to change from this baseline.

-----

## Headline

**Sr. AI Scientist & ML Team Lead | Computational Physicist**

-----

## Professional Summary

Broad positioning: AI/ML scientist with deep computational physics background, leading a team that builds production AI systems. Covers the full range — research, HPC solution architecture, and operational ML engineering.

Key themes:
1. AI-powered weather forecasting systems (current role at Spire Global)
2. HPC/GPU computing expertise
3. PhD in Computational Physics — scientific rigor
4. Team leadership and cross-functional collaboration
5. Client-facing technical communication (from LuxProvide)

-----

## Core Competencies — Ordering

Baseline ordering reflects a balanced profile, not weighted toward any specific role:

1. **ML Engineering & HPC** — PyTorch, TensorFlow, GPU computing (A100, H200), distributed computing (CuPy, Dask, RAPIDS, Numba), MLflow
2. **AI Weather & NWP Models** — AIFS, Aurora, FourCastNet, GraphCast, AI Data Assimilation, S2S forecasting, probabilistic verification
3. **Data Engineering & Processing** — Satellite data, GRIB2, ERA5 reanalysis
4. **Programming & Tools** — Python (xarray, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Cartopy), Bash, FORTRAN, Git, CI/CD, AWS
5. **Solution Architecture** — HPC infrastructure design, technical discovery, client engagement
6. **Leadership** — ML team management, cross-functional collaboration, stakeholder communication

## Professional Experience

### Spire Global (Nov 2022 – Present) — Sr. AI Scientist & ML Team Lead
- Balanced description of AI model deployment, data engineering, forecasting, team leadership
- Includes renewable energy forecasting but does not lead with it
- Mentions satellite context naturally (Spire is a satellite company)

### LuxProvide (Feb 2021 – Nov 2022) — Sr. Solutions Engineer
- Expanded description including solution architecture, GPU benchmarking, client engagement
- Highlights HPC/AI solutions delivery and pre-sales technical work

### Amazon (Oct 2019 – Jan 2021) — Research Scientist
- Brief: ML and statistical methods for business insights at scale

-----

## Key Attributes

- Production AI/ML delivery at scale
- Scientific rigor & operational focus
- Customer success & stakeholder communication
- Cross-functional team builder

-----

## What to Include

- All 6 languages
- All achievements and publications
- Solution architecture and client-facing skills
- AWS/cloud skills
- Photo

## What to Exclude

- Role-specific framing (don't over-index on any single domain)
- Startup ideas or side projects
- Exaggerated claims about capabilities still in development

-----

## Design Notes

- Single A4 page target
- Two-column AltaCV-inspired layout (34% sidebar, 66% main)
- Accent color: cyan `#3bc0e3`
- If content overflows, reduce spacing or trim bullet points — never go to page 2 for the baseline
